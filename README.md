<h3>Hi, I'm Tom ðŸ‘‹</h3>

I'm a Software Developer from Austria, running my own company with my long-term work colleague. In the past 15 years I worked on various websites and projects, mainly with PHP,  MySQL, Laravel, Zend or WordPress. Some of them are smaller ([wiet.at](https://www.wiet.at/)) and some are larger ([gebrauchtwagen.at](https://www.gebrauchtwagen.at/)). 

Right now I'm enjoying JavaScript and Frontend Development (React / Next.js).
